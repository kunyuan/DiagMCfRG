The folder "diagram" contains a python codebase to generate Feynman/Hugenholtz diagrams. The following is a list of important files:

- diagram.py:     Basic functions and data structure for generic diagrams
- free_energy.py: A class to handle Free energy diagrams
- polar.py:       A class to handle polarization diagrams
- main.py:        Control the workflow of the diagram generation

# External libraries:
