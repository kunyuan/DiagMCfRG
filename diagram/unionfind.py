#There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature, i.e., if A is friend of B and B is friend of C, then A is also friend of C. A friend circle is a group of students who are directly or indirectly friends.

#You are given a N×N − matrix M which consists of characters Y or N. If M[i][j]=Y, then ith and jth students are friends with each other, otherwise not. You have to print the total number of friend circles in the class.

#Each element of matrix friends will be Y or N.
#Number of rows and columns will be equal in the matrix.

#Example 1
#Input:
    #YYNN
    #YYYN
    #NYYN
    #NNNY
#Output: 2
